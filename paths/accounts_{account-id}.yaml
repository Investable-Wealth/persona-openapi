delete:
  description: >-
    Permanently deletes personally identifiable information (PII) for an Account
    and all associated Inquiries, Verifications and Reports. The response
    indicates a successful redaction of the Account. Redaction of the Account's
    associated child objects are done asynchronously and may take  some time
    before all associated child objects are fully redacted. **This action cannot
    be undone**.


    This endpoint can be used to comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR /
    CCPA or to enforce data privacy.


    Note: An account is still updatable after redaction. If you want to delete
    data continuously, please reach out to us to help you setup a retention
    policy.
